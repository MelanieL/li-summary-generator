# Personal Project: A LinkedIn Summary Generator

This is a personal project that I've been poking around with for a long time. I challenged myself to recreate some of the styling found on LinkedIn.

This generator uses javascript, webpack, scss and html. It's a Mad Libs type form where users enter some info about themselves, and it will generate short summary for the about section on their profile.

## Update - Jan 4th, 2020

I haven't touched this project in almost a year but it has always bugged me that I never finished it, so I decided to pick it back up. In 2020, I'm challenging myself to create everyday, which will often be in the form of coding or writing.

## Special Thanks

I used the following webpack boilerplate for this project, and highly recommend it for anyone curious about webpack:
